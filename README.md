# pokemon_style_game_demo
<h1>Description</h1>
This is a demo project for a pokemon style game using javascirpt, HTML, and CSS. Simply a demo to learn and show what I can do.
<h1>Site to Play</h1>
I have this on GitHub pages to allow others to trial it and test it for themselves.
<h1>Plans for the Future</h1>
Later I am planning on slowly incorporating the following:
<ul>
  <li>Movement based on the landing on the grid squares, not just by 3 pixels per keydown,</li>
  <li>Player menu (keeping track of players monsters),</li>
  <li>Battle other computer players,</li>
  <li>Talking to computer players,</li>
  <li>Going inside a house,</li>
</ul>
I may do more depending on what seems important for me to learn.
