# pokemon_style_game_demo
<h2>Description</h2>
This is a demo project for a pokemon style game using javascirpt, HTML, and CSS. Simply a demo to learn and show what I can do.
<h2>Site to Play</h2>
I have this on GitHub pages to allow others to trial it and test it for themselves. Page link is found <a href="https://typetty.github.io/pokemon_style_game_demo/">here</a>.
<h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
Later I am planning on slowly incorporating the following:
<ul>
  <li>Movement based on the landing on the grid squares, not just by 3 pixels per keydown,</li>
  <li>Player menu (keeping track of players monsters),</li>
  <li>Battle other computer players,</li>
  <li>Talking to computer players,</li>
  <li>Going inside a house,</li>
</ul>
I may do more depending on what seems important for me to learn.
